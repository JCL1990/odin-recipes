    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is for cooking <em>"fall off the bone"</em>beef ribs in that pretty, fancy air fryer with all the buttons (Don't feel judged. The air fryer accounts for half of our power bill.)</p>
    <p>Season those ribs and pop them in the air fryer. Let them cook while watching that new Sonic movie your kids have been talking about.</p>
    <p><strong>Let's get to it.</strong></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 rack of Beef Short Ribs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of garlic pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of your favorite bbq rub - <em>just to ensure that they have plenty of flavor</em></li>
        <li>1/2 cup of bbq sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the ribs</li>
        <li>Pat dry with paper towels</li>
        <li>Peel off the silver membrane from the back of the ribs, using a bonig knife.</li>
        <li>Apply olive oil to the ribs</li>
        <li>Apply all of the seasoning, both sides.</li>
        <li>Preheat your air fryer to 320 degrees, then pop the short ribs in meat side up for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the timer sounds, flip them over and cook at 320 for another 5-10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>At this point, if you have sides bring them to the table.</p>
        <p>If not, make sure to get a rib in those hands <strong>and show them whose house it is.</strong></p>
