    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pull out your oven mits, and that kiss the cook apron that grandma gave you.</p>
    <p><strong> We're about to throw down like she would.</strong></p>
     <p><em>Lets get to it.</em></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6lbs of beef short ribs.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of garlic pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup teaspoon of your favorite bbq rub - <em>just to ensure that they have plenty of flavor.</em></li>
       </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the ribs</li>
        <li>Pat dry with paper towels</li>
        <li>Remove membrane from back of the ribs.</li>
        <li>Apply all of the seasoning on both sides.</li>
        <li>Go preheat that oven to 275 to give the seasonings time to soak into the meat.</li>
        <li>Place the ribs in a large baking dish or roasting pan and cover the pan with foil. Bake for 2 hours and 45 minutes to 3 hours, or until the meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the ribs from the oven.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to broil then put the ribs back in the oven to broil for 5-10 minutes.</li>    
        <li>Take the ribs out of the oven and let them cool for 10-15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
        <p>Now take that apron off and stop acting like granny. You're looking up recipes, she already knows what it need!</p>
