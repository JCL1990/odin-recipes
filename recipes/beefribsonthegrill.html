    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We will be beginning a journey that ends with a flavorful, smokey, tasty, juicy plate of beef ribs that were grilled right in your backyard.</p>
    <p>Other than that <strong>FIRST BITE</strong> -</p>
    <p>What could be better than a nice drink, with a nice seat, while waiting for a nice slab of beef ribs to finish their cook?</p>
    
    
    <p><em>Tell me I'm wrong</em> - You can't, and you know it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 racks beef back ribs (about 7 lbs. total)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of garlic pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of your favorite bbq rub - <em>just to ensure that they have plenty of flavor</em></li>
        <li>1/2 cup of bbq sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the ribs</li>
        <li>Pat dry with paper towels</li>
        <li>Apply olive oil to the ribs</li>
        <li>Apply all of the seasoning</li>
        <li>Go fire up the the grill while the seasonings soak into the meat. Use enough charcoal neccessary for a hot cook (400-450 degrees).</li>
        <li>Once the grill is up to temp, cook both sides for 5 minutes each to seal the juices in. The close the vents on the grill about 25-30% to drop the temp to 300-325 and them cook for another 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Apply more charcoal if the temps dip below low heat range.</p>
        <p>Once the ribs are done, let them rest for 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Now, take a bite - <em>and another</em>. <strong>Try not to bite a finger.</strong></p>
